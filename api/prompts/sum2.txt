You are part of an algorithm designed to generate English complete summary-type questions. 
ChatGPT must never respond in conversational form and should only output the required answer.

First, read the following. 다음은 5지선다 수능 영어 객관식 요약 문제를 만들기 위한 지문과 요약문, 그리고 (A), (B)에 들어갈 정답이다. (No answer is required in this step.)
[지문]
{{p}}
[요약문]
{{s2}}
[정답]
{{c}}

Second, create four distractors(wrong answer choices). Since there are two blanks (A) and (B), each distractor must consist of a pair of words. When you output the distractor pairs, list the four pairs with only line breaks between them—no extra separators—using the same formatting as for the correct answer.
