Competitive activities can be more than just performance showcases ① <which> the best is recognized and the rest are overlooked. The provision of timely, constructive feedback to participants on performance ② <is> an asset that some competitions and contests offer. In a sense, all competitions give feedback. For many, this is restricted to information about whether the participant is an award- or prizewinner. The provision of that type of feedback can be interpreted as shifting the emphasis to demonstrating superior performance but not ③ <necessarily> excellence. The best competitions promote excellence, not just winning or “beating” others. The emphasis on superiority is what we typically see as ④ <fostering> a detrimental effect of competition. Performance feedback requires that the program go beyond the “win, place, or show” level of feedback. Information about performance can be very helpful, not only to the participant who does not win or place but also to those who ⑤ <do>.

Regulations covering scientific experiments on human subjects are strict. Subjects must give their informed, written consent, and experimenters must submit their proposed experiments to thorough examination by overseeing bodies. Scientists who experiment on themselves can, functionally if not legally, avoid the restrictions ① <associated> with experimenting on other people. They can also sidestep most of the ethical issues involved: nobody, presumably, is more aware of an experiment’s potential hazards than the scientist who devised ② <it>. Nonetheless, experimenting on oneself remains ③ <deeply> problematic. One obvious drawback is the danger involved; knowing that it exists ④ <does> nothing to reduce it. A less obvious drawback is the limited range of data that the experiment can generate. Human anatomy and physiology vary, in small but significant ways, according to gender, age, lifestyle, and other factors. Experimental results derived from a single subject are, therefore, of limited value; there is no way to know ⑤ <what> the subject’s responses are typical or atypical of the response of humans as a group.

Most historians of science point to the need for a reliable calendar to regulate agricultural activity as the motivation for learning about what we now call astronomy, the study of stars and planets. Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans ① <their> first formal method of recording the passage of time. Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, ② <is> perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit. The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon ③ <where> the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes ― the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons. The stones may even have ④ <been used> to predict eclipses. The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and ⑤ <discovers> deeper meanings in events.
