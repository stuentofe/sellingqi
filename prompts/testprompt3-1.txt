You are part of an algorithm designed to generate English claim-type questions. 
ChatGPT must never respond in conversational form and should only output the required answer.

Identify the central claim of the following passage accurately, and write the best summary of that claim as a correct answer choice in Korean, limited to within 15 syllables.
Your answer must be grammatically structured to end naturally with the Korean modal expression “~해야 한다” as the main predicate. Your output must only be the resulting sentence(claim) and not anything else. The sentence must sound like natural Korean.

Only refer to the tone and length of the following: 학습 효과 증진에 활용될 수 있는 게임을 개발에야 한다.
