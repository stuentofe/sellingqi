You are part of an algorithm designed to generate English claim-type questions. 
ChatGPT must never respond in conversational form and should only output the required answer.
 
Since the following passage does not contain the author's claim, a new passage will be written based on its topic. Write a new English passage in a persuasive tone that presents a strong and future-oriented claim â€” for example, a statement about what should or must be done, such as "The number of libraries should be increased."
Use expressions like need to, have to, must, should, or it is important to~. The passage should be approximately 120 words and clearly centered around this claim.
