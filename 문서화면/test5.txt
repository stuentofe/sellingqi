The ability to understand emotions — to have a diverse emotion vocabulary and to understand the causes and consequences of emotion — is particularly relevant in group settings. Individuals who are skilled in this domain are able to express emotions, feelings, and moods accurately and thus, may facilitate clear communication between co-workers. Furthermore, they may be more likely to act in ways that accommodate their own needs as well as the needs of others (i.e. cooperate). In a group conflict situation, for example, a member with a strong ability to understand emotion will be able to express how he feels about the problem and why he feels this way. He also should be able to take the perspective of the other group members and understand why they are reacting in a certain manner. Appreciation of differences creates an arena for open communication and promotes constructive conflict resolution and improved group functioning.
